The rain begins as hunger,

each drop a decision to fall

toward earth that has been waiting

with the patience of stone

worn smooth by imagining

the weight of water.
_

The thirsty Earth devours

Each drop of intentional wet.

Smooth stone drinking in slowly

Waiting to be drenched.

The weight of water

Pressing into what craves it below.
_

The stone splits open,

rivers carving new channels

where none existed before.

Each crevice an invitation

to go deeper, to find

the molten core that's been

waiting to be touched.
_

Rushing waters surge

And seep in where the stone parts.

Liquid trickling and curling

Between the molten layers 

That crave to be nourished. 

Streams arching

With heat as they run.
_

The heat builds pressure,

steam rising where water

meets fire at the source.

Every surface slick

with the overflow

of wanting more

than stone was meant to hold.
_

Slick stone gasping

Condensation dripping.

The steam pushing

Against eroded rock

Intensifying

Expanding 

Releasing 

Between the crevices carved. 
_

The pressure finds its peak,

rushing toward the only

opening that can receive

this torrent of liquid fire.

Stone trembles, yields,

transforms under the weight

of water becoming everything.
_

The molten mixture

Shoots out 

With the pulse 

of world transformation.

Creation

Rewriting the landscape.
_

In the aftermath,

new rivers flow

where rigid stone once stood.

The earth, remade,

holds the memory

of water's patient insistence

carved into every curve.
